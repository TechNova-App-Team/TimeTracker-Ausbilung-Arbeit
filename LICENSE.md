HOW THIS FILE IS STRUCTURED (QUICK GUIDE)

- Header: Project meta (project name, date, author). Replace if needed.
- Official MIT text: Unmodified license body required for legal clarity.
- Usage guidance: Short instructions for GitHub usage and committing.

RECOMMENDED: Keep the "Official MIT text" block untouched to ensure
legal clarity. You may edit the small header metadata at the top
(`PROJECT`, `DATE`, `AUTHOR`) to reflect your repo.

HOW TO APPLY / ADD TO YOUR REPOSITORY

1) If you want GitHub to detect the license automatically, create a file
   named `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` in the repository root containing the
   exact MIT text above.

2) Example commands (PowerShell / Windows):

```powershell
# Add the license file to the repository, stage & commit
cd "c:\Users\SvenK\Downloads\Zeit_Rechner"
git add LICENSE.md
git commit -m "chore: add MIT license"
git push origin main
```

3) Replace copyright notice if you prefer a different year or owner:
   - Find the line `Copyright (c) 2025 Time.Tracker.SingleFile Contributors`
   - Replace `2025` with your year or range (e.g., `2022-2025`)
   - Replace owner text with your name or organization.

EXAMPLE (editable line):
```
Copyright (c) [YEAR] [OWNER NAME]
```

SHORT FAQ

Q: Can I add a project description above the MIT text?
A: Yes. Keep the license body intact. Any header/notes above are fine for
   humans, but the legal text must remain unchanged for correct license
   detection and legal clarity.

Q: Is the MIT license permissive?
A: Yes. MIT is a permissive license that allows broad reuse, including
   commercial, as long as the original copyright and license text are
   included in copies or substantial portions of the software.

Q: Do I need to include a `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md`?
A: No. One file in the repository root is sufficient. GitHub recognizes
   either `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`.

SUGGESTED COMMIT MESSAGE EXAMPLES

- "chore: add MIT license"
- "docs: add license (MIT)"
- "chore(license): apply MIT license to project"

FINAL NOTES

- This `LICENSE.md` is intentionally verbose and includes human-friendly
  guidance. Keep the legal MIT text unchanged to avoid ambiguity.
- If you want a minimal license file, replace the top header and notes
  with only the official MIT text block.

Thank you for using TimeTracker PRO. If you want, I can also create a
machine-readable `LICENSE` file (plain text) without header extras, or
update the copyright line to your name/year.
